            Hello, I am an aspiring web developer located in Bellingham, Washington. I am currently enrolled in a <strong>Software Engineering</strong> program through <strong>Flatiron School</strong>.
            I begin the course on 11/1/2021 and have greatly enjoyed opening the door to the world of programming. I am excited to learn much more when the school begins
            and dive in.
        </p>    
        <p class="bio">
            Before this new adventure I worked in a much different field. I recieved a <strong>BS in Geology</strong> from Western Washington University and spent the last ~10 years working
            in many different fields including mineral exploration and mining, oil and gas, and marine surveying. My last job was in the environmental laboratory at a local aluminum
            smelter running tests to monitor environmental impact of the site. The pandemic was the last straw for the plant and it shut down after over 50 years of operation.
            I spend most of my free time outdoors, travelling, and now coding!
